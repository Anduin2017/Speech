1
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:08,944
Yes, so someone asking that how to join Microsoft so

2
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,480
let me record this.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,305
OK, let's get started and hi everyone I'm Anduin.

4
00:00:16,305 --> 00:00:20,675
I'm a software engineer, and here at Microsoft.

5
00:00:20,675 --> 00:00:24,130
So yeah let's put this on.

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,366
I'm currently working on the Microsoft 365 team and

7
00:00:28,444 --> 00:00:33,072
focusing on the data center deployment of the Microsoft 365

8
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:34,484
backend systems.

9
00:00:34,484 --> 00:00:39,962
And yeah, Microsoft is an American technology company and headquarters

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,970
at Redmond and Washington and it develops software devices and

11
00:00:45,048 --> 00:00:49,821
related services which is best known products like Windows 10

12
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:54,828
Office and Azure Cloud. It also provides other services like

13
00:00:54,912 --> 00:00:56,080
hardware like.

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,755
Surface and Xbox. Also, Microsoft have developed plenty of famous

15
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:03,590
developing tools like Visual Studio.

16
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,662
Yeah, so I joined and then worked as a full

17
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:10,806
time employee and Microsoft for about one year and have some

18
00:01:10,878 --> 00:01:13,593
fantastic adventures that I can share.

19
00:01:13,593 --> 00:01:17,734
Yes, for most people is implying that working on Microsoft

20
00:01:17,805 --> 00:01:20,947
and not so busy nor tiring, well for us we

21
00:01:21,018 --> 00:01:24,659
believe that we can have a balance between work and

22
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,397
life since most of our products have benefits and run

23
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:30,122
for more than 30 years.

24
00:01:30,122 --> 00:01:33,973
So we're using that under that pressure to open new

25
00:01:34,048 --> 00:01:37,220
markets and serve new customers every day.

26
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,547
So working on Microsoft usually means that you can have.

27
00:01:40,548 --> 00:01:44,319
You can enjoy your daily life while contributing to one

28
00:01:44,387 --> 00:01:48,090
of the largest companies that change everybody's life.

29
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,968
Oh, I currently located in China.

30
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:53,846
I live in Suzhou, a beautiful City,

31
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:59,518
A beautiful and relaxing city with lots of attractions and near Shanghai.

32
00:01:59,518 --> 00:02:01,126
So I live in Suzhou while

33
00:02:01,126 --> 00:02:03,835
The person I report my work item.

34
00:02:03,835 --> 00:02:08,041
My work progress to is living in America so it's

35
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:10,015
just like a professor.

36
00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:14,520
He gave me a direction of development and I need

37
00:02:14,614 --> 00:02:18,180
to inform my work progress every week.

38
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,735
It provides a great freedom,

39
00:02:20,735 --> 00:02:25,229
a great flexibility to arrange your own time that,

40
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:29,554
like I usually wake up at 11:00 o'clock in the

41
00:02:29,648 --> 00:02:34,160
morning and starting work at 2:00 o'clock PM so.

42
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,763
Yeah, if we can have all my necessary work items

43
00:02:37,838 --> 00:02:41,290
finished early so I can stop working early.

44
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,329
I yeah working here. Just like doing homework,

45
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,896
in the college that if you finish all your

46
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,891
homework and get out to play yes so I can

47
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,389
have plenty of time.

48
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:56,468
So for club activities or physical exercise or maybe like

49
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:58,257
making videos like this.

50
00:02:58,256 --> 00:03:01,155
Yeah so let's get back to the title.

51
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:04,807
How can you like a new developer or student to

52
00:03:04,887 --> 00:03:08,936
have a chance to join Microsoft and what you need

53
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:09,730
to learn?

54
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,703
An can you started from our recruitment roles?

55
00:03:12,703 --> 00:03:15,297
Since Microsoft is a technology company,

56
00:03:15,298 --> 00:03:19,451
almost every position for Microsoft requires a bachelor degree in

57
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:21,751
computer science or related majors.

58
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:24,376
So if you want to say I don't qualify for

59
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,192
a bachelors degree in software engineering,

60
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:30,622
then sorry, the only choice left to you is to

61
00:03:30,698 --> 00:03:33,670
get a master degree back in the school.

62
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,085
Yeah last from my workmates have done on that path

63
00:03:37,153 --> 00:03:40,431
or you may mention that your school might not be

64
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,300
in the best class and if we can still get

65
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:47,210
a chance. My answer is don't worry bout that.

66
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:51,701
It depends of course that we providing possibilities for every

67
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,280
person.

68
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,932
If your other professional skills and experience are so solid

69
00:03:57,008 --> 00:04:01,203
that we may still consider hiring someone from a school

70
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:03,720
that does not sound such famous.

71
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,042
And yeah Microsoft large company that requires you to talk

72
00:04:08,118 --> 00:04:12,972
with others to solve problems together and it requires excellent

73
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:14,640
communication skills.

74
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,275
Of course in English, so usually we have about three

75
00:04:19,364 --> 00:04:21,860
to four meetings every week.

76
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:26,839
Yeah, which requires you to listen to talk and will

77
00:04:26,937 --> 00:04:29,280
write English in emails.

78
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,700
And also in code reviews with you ask you to

79
00:04:32,778 --> 00:04:37,598
communicate to speak in English during all those code reviews,

80
00:04:37,598 --> 00:04:42,655
including the interview. So English is so important but actually

81
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:45,223
English level of mine is enough.

82
00:04:45,223 --> 00:04:49,427
I'm not a native English speaker and I learned English

83
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:52,308
from only a Chinese-speaking school.

84
00:04:52,308 --> 00:04:55,543
But compared with vocabulary and grammar,

85
00:04:55,543 --> 00:04:59,910
we hope you can express your ideas bravely more.

86
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,629
I like my English not excellent of course,

87
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:05,575
but it's far enough for me to express my ideas

88
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,688
or do some simple presentations.

89
00:05:07,688 --> 00:05:10,217
That's fun, that's enough. Not so high.

90
00:05:10,217 --> 00:05:12,241
Yeah, yeah, you can express.

91
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:14,998
This is enough. And of course,

92
00:05:14,998 --> 00:05:19,383
the most necessary part for candidates is a solid knowledge

93
00:05:19,457 --> 00:05:21,910
of data structure and algorithms.

94
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,276
We actually don't require you to write C# before

95
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:27,801
we don't even need you to use Windows.

96
00:05:27,801 --> 00:05:30,042
You can use any operating systems.

97
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:34,332
Installing any editors, writing any programming language you like.

98
00:05:34,332 --> 00:05:37,431
But what we must examine is that you must have

99
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:41,970
a profound understanding of the data you want to manipulate.

100
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:47,690
And this requires you to make an intense accumulation in

101
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:50,550
mathematics an all rhythms.

102
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:56,353
Participating in algorithm competitions or frequent practice algorithm questions will

103
00:05:56,421 --> 00:05:58,674
help improve your written skills.

104
00:05:58,673 --> 00:06:05,310
Yes, which will greatly significantly benefit you during the interview.

105
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,635
And yeah, you really there gonna be four to five

106
00:06:08,704 --> 00:06:12,930
turns of interviewing where we examine your algorithm skills.

107
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,467
We don't need that to be so extremes.

108
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:18,872
For example, if you don't know the red black tree,

109
00:06:18,872 --> 00:06:20,407
you no worries is fun.

110
00:06:20,407 --> 00:06:23,545
Absolutely fun for me. I don't know the black,

111
00:06:23,546 --> 00:06:26,837
red black tree. What he said you can just suggest

112
00:06:26,904 --> 00:06:30,598
the interview with the change of question to easier and

113
00:06:30,665 --> 00:06:34,829
easier question when you really just ask some simple questions

114
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:39,698
like can you rotate a matrix without allocating new space

115
00:06:39,783 --> 00:06:41,150
a square matrix?

116
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,155
I will try that if you can finish a middle

117
00:06:44,227 --> 00:06:47,017
level question in less than 20 minutes,

118
00:06:47,017 --> 00:06:51,244
you have a high possibility already have a high possibility

119
00:06:51,315 --> 00:06:52,390
pass interview.

120
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,613
Yeah, if you can pass it all those five times

121
00:06:55,685 --> 00:06:57,762
you already about to join in.

122
00:06:57,762 --> 00:07:00,660
So yeah, not only the algorithm at last,

123
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,861
that also would be better if you have incredible experience

124
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:09,419
including working for years in those related areas or Community

125
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,416
contribution.

126
00:07:10,415 --> 00:07:12,140
That is to say, yeah.

127
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,571
If I have a famous project on GitHub or have

128
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:19,471
an account on Stack Overflow with a high score or

129
00:07:19,549 --> 00:07:24,306
something like this that have some open source contributions,

130
00:07:24,305 --> 00:07:26,475
yeah, that is also counted.

131
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:30,276
We will consider that. And I also suggest you to

132
00:07:30,355 --> 00:07:33,443
host A blog of your own so that you can

133
00:07:33,523 --> 00:07:37,640
write technology articles everyday on your own blog.

134
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,525
At that will not only benefit your interview,

135
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,672
but also it is a record of what you have

136
00:07:43,751 --> 00:07:44,380
learned.

137
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,331
So in brief, there are four targets for you.

138
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:50,348
One is bachelor's degree in computer science,

139
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:54,545
the second one is excellent English communication scale skills.

140
00:07:54,546 --> 00:07:58,663
The third one is solid algorithm knowledge and the 4th

141
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:01,560
one is technology related experience.

142
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,961
All those four targets are required,

143
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:07,227
so yeah, if you already already ready in all those

144
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:10,950

00:08:58,937 --> 00:08:59,733
two weeks.

161
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:03,049
Yeah, considering the impact of COVID-19,

162
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:07,937
Microsoft is now working remotely that even in China we

163
00:09:08,026 --> 00:09:11,936
here we don't have to go to the office every

164
00:09:12,025 --> 00:09:12,380
day.

165
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,792
While we support remote working life,

166
00:09:14,793 --> 00:09:17,742
I also don't suggest you to try a position out

167
00:09:17,806 --> 00:09:21,332
of your country which have a lower possibility to pass.

168
00:09:21,332 --> 00:09:22,729
So if it is possible,

169
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:26,620
please consider a job within your own country.

170
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,145
And yeah, I'm always looking forward to your success message.

171
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:33,827
Microsoft is always a warm and welcoming family that we're

172
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,540
always expecting you guys.

173
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,267
Everybody gathered here. We just hired.

174
00:09:38,268 --> 00:09:42,247
One target is One Direction to solve problems together and

175
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,128
you know we we don't know who we might be

176
00:09:45,197 --> 00:09:49,450
collaborating that those persons might from different nations.

177
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,518
Different colors, different religions, yeah,

178
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:55,909
but we just gathered here as a family and solving

179
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:57,224
