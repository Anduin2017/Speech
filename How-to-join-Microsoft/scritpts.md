# How to join Microsoft?

Hi. My name is Anduin. And I'm a software engineer at Microsoft. I'm working at Microsoft 365 team and focusing on the datacenter deployment of the Microsoft 365 backend systems.

Microsoft Corporation is an American technology company, headquarters in Redmond, Washington. It develops software, devices, and related services with its best-known products like Windows 10, Office Suite, and Azure cloud. It also provides hardware like Surface and Xbox. Also, Microsoft developed plenty of famous developing tools like Visual Studio and '. NET'.

I joined and worked as a full-time employee at Microsoft for about one year and experienced some fantastic adventures.

As for most people, they may point that working at Microsoft is not so busy nor tiring. While for us we believe that we could make a balance between work and life. Since most of our products benefit and run for more than 30 years, we are usually not under that much pressure to open new markets and serve new customers every day. Working at Microsoft usually means that you can enjoy your daily life while contributing to one of the largest companies that may change everybody's everyday life.

I located in China currently. I live in Suzhou, a beautiful and relaxing city with plenty of attractions near Shanghai. While the person I report my work progress to is living in America. So when he just gave me a direction or development, I need to inform my work progress every week. It provides me great freedom and flexibility to arrange my time. I usually wake up at 11:00 and start working at 2:00. If I can have all my necessary work items done and I can stop working earlier. Working here is just like doing my homework in college, and I can have plenty of time for club activities and physical exercise.

So, how can you, I mean the new developer, student, or open-source contributor, have a chance to join Microsoft? What do you need to learn?

Getting started with our recruitment rules, since Microsoft is a technology company, almost every position of Microsoft requires a bachelor's degree in Computer science or related majors. If you want to say: I'm sorry, I don't qualify for a bachelor's degree in software engineering. Then the only choice left to you is to get a master's degree in school, and lots of my workmates have done on that path.

Or you may mention that your school might not be in the best class and if you can still get a chance. My answer is: it depends. If your other professional skills and experience are solid, We may still consider hiring someone from a school that does not sound such famous.

And Microsoft is a large company that requires you to talk with others to solve problems together, and it also requires excellent communication skills in English. Usually, we have about 3-4 meetings every week, which requires you to listen and talk. And we are writing English in emails and code reviews. We will ask you to communicate in English during the interview. The level of English as mine is enough. I'm not a native English speaker, and I learned my English only from a Chinese-speaking school. Compared with vocabulary and grammar, we hope you can express your ideas bravely more. My English is not that excellent, and it's far enough to express my ideas or do presentations, and that's fine.

Of course, the most necessary part for a candidate is a solid knowledge of data structure and algorithms. We don't require you to write C# before. We even don't need you to use Windows. You can use any OS with any editor to write any programming language. But what we must examine is that you must have a profound understanding of the data you want to manipulate. And this requires you to make an intense accumulation in mathematics and algorithms. Participating in algorithm competitions or frequent practicing algorithm questions will help improve your algorithm skills which significantly benefits you during the interview.

Usually, there are going to be 4-5 turns of interviewing. While we examine your algorithm skills, we don't need that to be so extreme. For example, if you don't know the red-black tree, no worries, it's fine. Just suggest the interviewer change a question. We usually ask some simple questions like rotate a matrix without allocating new space. You can have a try now. If you can finish a middle-level question in less than 20 minutes, you have a high possibility to pass the interview, and you need to pass all five turns.

At last, it also would be better if you have an incredible experience, including working for years in related areas or community contribution. That is to say: Hey, contribute on GitHub or Stack Overflow website is also counted. If you have a famous project or owning a Stack Overflow with a high score, we will also consider that. Also, I suggest you host a blog online and keep writing technology articles that will not only benefit your interview but also as a record of what you learned.

So, in brief, there are four targets for you.

* Bachelor's degree in Computer science.
* Excellent English communication skills.
* Solid algorithm knowledge.
* Technology related experience

If you are ready in all those four areas, you can say that you are prepared to join Microsoft. I can help refer you to a position to get a higher possibility to get an interview soon. Open careers.microsoft.com and find a job you like. Please send me the link to my email: anduin.xue@microsoft.com with the title 'Refer request'. Also, please attach your resume with your Linkedin or GitHub account. Hopefully, you can have your interview in 2 weeks.

Considering the impact of the COVID-19, Microsoft is now working remotely worldwide. Even in China, we don't have to go to the office every day. Usually, I don't suggest people try a position out of their country. But remote working has increased the possibility to pass. So if it's possible, please consider a job located within your country.

Finally, I'm always looking forward to your success message. Microsoft is a warm and welcoming family that we are always expecting new guys. Everybody gathered here and work and collaborate with people you don't know from different nations, colors, and religions.
